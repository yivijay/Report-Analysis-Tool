# Report-Analysis-Tool
A java tool that would take multiple reports from various systems and combine them into a single report to provide a high level view of what was happening in all the systems at a given point in time.
It would also find points of failures in the systems and try to find the reason for those failures base upon the snapshot of other systems at that point of time.
(Specific to Performance Testing)
