1. Added file called index1.html. It is supposed to replace index.jsp.

1. Added columns first_name, last_name to the user_credentials database on my system.

2. Added session Trackers to all jsp files whose links are referred to in the Vmenu file.
	This is to ensure that a user has to log-in before he can navigate through the rest to the wesite.
	
3. Changed the Login.jsp file.
	Added another condition statement. if(toggle.equals("logout")), then invalidate session object.
	This is to ensure proper logout.
	
4. Added getUName function to userAuthentication.java. This function gives the user name corresponding to the user id.

5. Stored username as a Session Attribute from Auth.jsp if login is successful.
	This is so that the username can be displayed on all the pages.
	
6. Changed Header.html to header.jsp and added a script which decides the header message.
	the header message is different when the user logs in. 
	---------This still needs work as I am not able to refresh the header frame when the user logs in.------------
